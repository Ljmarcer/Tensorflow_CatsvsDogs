# Tensorflow_CatsvsDogs
> Tensorflow construction of  2 CNN and a dense model to predict cat or dogs with data augmentation.
## Load the dataset
Download the dataset from tensorflow directly
## 3 initial models
First, with the normal train data, we create 3 models:
- Dense
- CNN no dropout
- CNN with dropout
## Data Augmentation
with data augmentation function from tensorflow _ImageGenerator_ we create new dogs and cats image and throw the models again to see the differences
